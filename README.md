# $\LaTeX$ Repo

Added README.md for $\LaTeX$ Repo

# Purpose
The purpose of this repo is to show my ability to create nice looking $\LaTeX$ (sorry, I like the way it looks) documents for my graduate school assignments. This repo will have a .sty file that is used globally throughout and will be updated gradually and consistently to showcase a more refined, personal style. I hope this will be used both by myself and others to learn a thing or two about this wonderful tool to create nice, professional documents both in and out of school.

# Structure
The file structure is a little wonky as of right now, but here is the general breakdown:

- **build** - This will contain all the `.pdf` and `.synctex.gz` files that are necessary for the output of the code, and when the $\LaTeX$ extension in VSCode is compiling it will be used for all the intermediary steps of building the file.
- **images** - Rather self explanatory. This will contain the... well... images. And yes, *all* of them.
- **Class Specific Files** - Each class specific folder (ML, UrbComp, etc...) will contain *completed* files, or files that I will not be returning to regularly. They are more of a storage than an organization.
- **General** - This is not a file, but just the general area of the LaTeX folder. This will contain the `.sty` file, the README.md, and any current assignments/projects that I am working on. This is the area that I will work in and create new files.
