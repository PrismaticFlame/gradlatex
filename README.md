# $\LaTeX$ Class Notes and Outline Generator

# Purpose
The purpose of this repo is to show my ability to create nice looking $\LaTeX$ (sorry, I like the way it looks) documents for my graduate school assignments. This repo will have a .sty file that is used globally throughout and will be updated gradually and consistently to showcase a more refined, personal style. I hope this will be used both by myself and others to learn a thing or two about this wonderful tool to create nice, professional documents both in and out of school.

# Structure
The file structure is a little wonky as of right now, but here is the general breakdown:

- **build** - This will contain all the `.pdf` and `.synctex.gz` files that are necessary for the output of the code, and when the $\LaTeX$ extension in VSCode is compiling it will be used for all the intermediary steps of building the file.
- **images** - Rather self explanatory. This will contain the... well... images. And yes, *all* of them.
- **Class Specific Files** - Each class specific folder (ML, UrbComp, etc...) will contain *completed* files, or files that I will not be returning to regularly. They are more of a storage than an organization.
- **Root** - This will contain the `.sty` file, the README.md, and any current assignments/projects that I am working on. This is the area that I will work in and create new files.

# Goals

I have a few goals in mind with this repo:

- **.tex Maker** - A python script using OCR to read PDF's, and then either through a small, local model or through API calls to a larger model, use an LLM to create a sensible template for the homework file utilizing previous files as reference. I know there are a few tools out there, a couple already on GitHub by other users, but I would like to create my own and understand some of the technology behind OCR, API calling to LLM's/using a local model, and using RAG (because of the local reference files)
- **Beautifying the Simple** - Going through the effort of what could easily be throwing some words and pictures into a word document and instead making it into a nicely formatted file that can be read with ease is something I like. I want to find a rhythm and then make my own "style" that can be easily identified, understood, and used.
- **Workplace Readiness** - I will hopefully gain some useful workplace skills out of this endeavour. Making nicely formatted and well created reports will (I imagine) be a very useful skill that should help inter- and intra- workplace communication much easier. Although, I am sure that large companies are not using $\LaTeX$ for document write ups, but I will happily be wrong on that!


# Example
As an example of the work that I am putting into this, I will showcase a few of the finished files I have created for submission while getting my Masters degree.
